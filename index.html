				<p>Hello there! I am Chandra Shekhar Murmu, a <a href="http://people.iiti.ac.in/~astro/beta_astro/?page_id=26">PhD</a> student from the Department of Astronomy @ <a href="https://iiti.ac.in/departments">Indian Institute of Technology Indore</a> (IIT Indore). My research focuses on the Cosmology of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). This is the era in the Universe, when the early galaxies reionized the neutral gas distribution with ionizing radiation. Much of the stuff about this epoch is largely unknown, due to lack of good observational constraints. My current work deals with the possibility of using various multi-line observations of this epoch through line-intensity mapping (LIM), such as the redshifted <span style="font-family: Courier;">[H I] 21-cm</span> signal from the intergalactic medium (IGM) and <span style="font-family: Courier;">[C II] 158 micron</span> line from the early galaxies, so as to extract valuable statistics, e.g., the power spectrum and cross-power spectrum of the line-intensity maps. These statistics can potentially reveal a great deal about the statistical properties of the gas and source distributions, as well as the astrophysics of the reionization. Most of my research articles can be found on <a href="https://arxiv.org/a/murmu_c_1.html">arXiv</a>.</p>
